# Activity Exercises
"Cyber Defender" is a lesson which uses a classic tower-defence game structure as an analogy to teach cyber defence principles. It contains a short how-to-play Minecraft tutorial, a miniature library for cyber terminology definitions, a tower-defence tutorial, a 15-minute beginner game, a 45-minute beginner game and an advanced game mode. Familiarity with Minecraft controls, mechanics, mobs (Minecraft shorthand-speak for "mobile entity" - an AI-driven creature) or cyber security is not required to engage with and learn from this lesson; interaction mechanics are minimal, cyber elements are related to fundamental principles and the in-game prompts drive progression quickly.

<ul>
<li> Launch the slide deck Cyber Defender EDU Presentation. Present and advance the slides as far as "Action items" (20 minutes)
<li> Alternatively/in parallel with the slide deck, you can demonstrate the task using the fillowing steps:
  <ul>
    <li> Launch Minecraft: Education Edition.
  <li> Click "Play, then access the library by clicking "View Library".
  <li> Click "Sublect Kits", then "Computer Science".
  <li> Read the brief description at the top of the screen, then click the "Cyber" lesson pack.
  <li> Read the brief description at the top of the screen, then click the "Cyber Defender" lesson sub-pack.
  <li> Read the brief description at the top of the screen, then click the "Cyber Defender" lesson.
  <li> Read the description and learning objectives (make sure you click "Read More" and scroll, then click on the "Create World".
  <li> At this point, you will spawn in to the game in front of a banner. Click on the banner to launch a tutorial; if you have never played Minecraft before, click "Start Tutorial". If you have played before, click "Skip Tutorial".
  <li> If you chose to start the tutorial, you will be guided through movement - forwards, backwards, left and right, looking around, jumping and interacting with objects.
  <li> Once you complete the tutorial or skip it, you will enter the lobby. Here you can choose how you want to play Cyber Defender; above each of the four pictures in front of you is a sign which indicates the game mode which can me accessed by walking up to the   picture and interacting with it. Explore the room and when you're ready, simply walk up to the picture for the game mode you wish to play and interact with it (left-click) to teleport to the location.
  <li> Click the "SHORTENED BEGINNER" location.
  <li> Move forward and interact with the mailbox to begin the game guide and tutorial. Click through the dialogues to begin the tower defence tutorial; some steps of this will show you how the game works cinematically and restrict your ability to move and look, some will ask you to practice gameplay. Rather than demonstrating from here, I suggest quitting back to the lobby or reverting to the slide deck and allowing students to engage with the tutorial themselves.
  </ul>
<li> After the tutorial finishes, students can interact with the mailbox again to begin the tower defence game properly; guides and mini-tutorials will feature periodically to provide gameplay and cyber security information, tips and tricks.
<li> Students may spend on average 15 minutes playing though the shortened forest game; if they complete it more quickly, encourage them to explore the library or other game modes. (15 minutes)
<li> Ask students to quit the lesson by pressing escape, then choosing "Finish the lesson", and asking them to click on "Get Certificate" to download, print and sign their Cyber Defender certificate. Then they can return to Minecraft, click "Exit Lesson", then "Save and Exit" in the dialogue that follows.
<li> Advance the slides to the "Check for understanding" slide; facilitate discussion of the learning objectives listed here, and finish up the lession. If appropriate you may wish to signpost the students to the "Microsoft Security and Compliance Fundamentals" and/or "Explore cyber security careers" links found at the bottom of this page. (10 mins)
